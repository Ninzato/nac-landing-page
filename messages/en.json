      "varieties": "Barbecue briquettes often come in a variety of shapes and sizes to accommodate different grilling needs. The most prevalent on the market are stick and hexagonal shapes. However, they can come in traditional pillow-shaped briquettes, as well as larger briquettes or pieces of briquettes for longer cooking sessions or larger grills.",
      "note": "Barbecue briquettes are specifically designed for outdoor cooking and should not be used indoors or in enclosed spaces due to the release of carbon monoxide during combustion. It is also important to follow proper safety guidelines when handling and disposing of used briquettes to prevent fire hazards.",
